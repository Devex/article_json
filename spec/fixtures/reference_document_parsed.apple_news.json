As international investors have noted for decades, the Chinese way of conducting business is substantially different from Western methods, and requires sensitivity to the country’s practices and policies. Before opening an office in Shanghai, investors are advised to examine China’s five-year plan, which details the country’s social and economic goals and specifies which industries will receive greater focus to achieve greater financial growth. Drafting your own five-year plan that details your company’s objectives will make government approval for your business more attainable, and establish connections with valuable local resources like the ",

Trademarks established in the U.S. do not always remain your property once you cross Chinese borders; in fact, trademarks are usually granted to the first person to register it, regardless of whether that individual actually owns the product or property in question. And do your research when considering a bank; it’s best to find one with a corresponding relationship to the United States to simplify transactions. Consider and develop a digital presence for promotional purposes instead of traditional outlets like newspapers, television, and/or billboards. Online stores are utilized to a greater degree than brick-and-mortar locations, and advertising through social media platforms or other web sites will allow for greater impact with less physical expansion.",

Indirectness is also a significant element of any business transaction: to be respectful, avoid lengthy direct eye contact and too-firm handshakes, and refrain from asking direct questions. A firm ",
