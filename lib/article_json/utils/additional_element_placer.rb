    # This class allows the user to place additional elements within an article.
    # It distributes elements over the whole article and ensures that an
    # additional element is only ever placed between two paragraph elements or
    # after a paragraph and before the next headline. If there are not enough
    # spaces, the remaining additional elements will be appended to the existing
    # article elements.
    class AdditionalElementPlacer
      # @param [Array[ArticleJSON::Article::Elements::Base]] elements
      # @param [Array[Object]] additional_elements
      def initialize(elements, additional_elements)
        @elements = elements&.dup
        @additional_elements = additional_elements
      end

      # Distribute additional elements evenly throughout the article elements
      #
      # Outline of the algorithm:
      # 1. It calculates every how many characters (only considering paragraphs)
      #    an additional element should be inserted, given the number of
      #    additional elements provided
      # 2. It then iterates over the existing elements within the article,
      #    inserting them into the resulting, merged article
      # 3. As soon as it has passed the right amount characters, it checks if
      #    the current position is eligible for inserting an additional element
      #    (the previous element needs to be a paragraph and the following needs
      #    to be either a paragraph or a headline)
      #     a) If so, it inserts the additional element and recalculates in how
      #        many characters the next element should be inserted, based on the
      #        remaining number of characters and remaining additional elements
      #     b) If not, it keeps iterating over the article until it finds an
      #        eligible position and only then inserts the additional element
      #        and recalculates the number of characters until the next
      #        insertion
      # 4. If there are still additional elements remaining which couldn't be
      #    inserted (due to not finding enough eligible positions), they are
      #    appended to the end of the article
      #
      # @return [Array[ArticleJSON::Elements::Base|Object]]
